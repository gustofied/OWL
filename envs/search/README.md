Shelf Envs

Goes sort of into this, https://x.com/n0riskn0r3ward/status/1936453625527648323

So we store things in shelves, and what you can see in a book shelf or a movie shelf for example is the title, some colour, we are looking at the spine, perhaps the publisher, author, date, and for movies or music it's different from what you see, but usually a title. This shelf is randomized sometimes in where things are in the shelf, sometimes after genre, sometimes after author, a person could sort this himself how he wants. The agent can decide upon looking at the shelf how or if he will sort the shelf, before he starts the search. Movie shelf. Book shelf

Adds onto what we talk about in shelf

Agentic RAG, https://vivekkalyan.com/writing/rag-rl/ I think this really goes into what we think about the shelf idea, and creating a search env for knowledge, tools for it to learn etc, and from there the agent learns to retrieve data the best way. Here too, https://vivekkalyan.com/rag-agents-rl/

Another point to agentic rag you could say, This is very interesting it shows how most of the tools in windsurf are mostly search tool, https://x.com/jobergum/status/1906631610952270158
