Shelf Envs

Goes sort of into this, https://x.com/n0riskn0r3ward/status/1936453625527648323

So we store things in shelves, and what you can see in a book shelf or a movie shelf for example is the title, some colour, we are looking at the spine, perhaps the publisher, author, date, and for movies or music it's different from what you see, but usually a title. This shelf is randomized sometimes in where things are in the shelf, sometimes after genre, sometimes after author, a person could sort this himself how he wants. The agent can decide upon looking at the shelf how or if he will sort the shelf, before he starts the search. Movie shelf. Book shelf
