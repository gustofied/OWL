Ramble: oki for game mechanics behaviours, a user can move the "main arrow"
left arrow on keyboard to rotate to the left and right arrow on keyboard to go right
This would be cool to introduce but this human input layer might be out of scope for now
We would want an agent to do this, no need for a human player right now.
So if we wanted to we would need an update function that changes the pos when we hold one of they keys..
It does some force?

well game_1 is a basic game but leads heavy into basics and visuals (observability), which sets up nicley for game 2 - 3 - 4 etc, those games
adds on firstly more you could call game mechanics/things but then more gameplay, Game AI etc

In addition to the simple game, we ofc here introduce some way of the game to be played and interacted by a LLM agent
What we have implemented to do this is simple driver/loop, and some translation of action space into the observatoin for agent

The observabillty consits of wandb, rerun, and logging module, we explore this combo, we want wandb to capture the runs and all.
rerun makes it easier to tap into what happens in real time, and gives nice visuals to build our intution and debugging live
log for log yeh, and can be saved in wandb, and showcased in rerun live too. We explore this setup, try to build on it, and think this
is the future of observabillity for owl

Oki so at last, this is game 1, game 1 is basic, we have a unit circle, two arrows, some calucations like dot, cross, angle, 
we try to have the llm steer one of the arrows, and the other arrows become the goal, it needs to learn have to steer it best.
Learn maybe wrong word here, we just want to tailor our translation from the actionm space to the best possible observation for the agent.
That's our hoaning in here, in future games, look into more rewards machines, FSM, interaction stack, memory tools, etc
