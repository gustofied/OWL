## Explination of the Color game

Well let me explain the game, it's a board game played from on top you drop pieces into the board, and they could pair to create colours, and they could create trios and lock to a colour. The colour you can drop is a primary, so red green and blue. These could pair mix to a secondary if they land on one or their is primary to the left or right of it , so a neighbour . when they mix they become a pair, in the same turn their is the last phase which could take seconriares and turn them into a trio of locked primary, this is then the same mix as pair mix so you first check the first cell where you dropped its neighbour then you shcekc if the other pair cell has a neighbour of a secondary we could mix with , if so the two different secondaries become a primary and that three cells now are locked.. and all these can only happens once per turn. The idea is that this new colour game is fun for now, but in the future in the chaos of multiple entites interacting with colours and possible patterns
if we could create something emergent, if for instance there is ways to win, the we will see also looks beatiful rather than just chaos? if there are nouvel plays , and if patterns and color combos connect , makes sense, and why these pattern emerge in real life too, from flowers to trees to animals to water etc more complex and more matching chemistry to what we see in real life..
local interactions , feedback, and constraints.

## Future

I'm interested in color theory, and wonder if I could turn this game in the future to be some pattern color maker, and if the chaos. Maybe unclude links and ideas to color theyro here?
