### Fundementals

**Fundamental resources for understanding the mechanics and motivations behind Monte Carlo Tree Search.**

- **Monte Carlo Tree Search Video by Michael Wollowski** — [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99gPnlfr7Jo)  
  _Overall great little video going into MCTS and some of its concepts._

- **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) Tutorial Video by Fullstack Academy** — [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99gPnlfr7Jo)  
  _Dabbles into not just MCTS but more—gives a bigger grasp around MCTS, concise about MCTS, a bit unclear, but still a nice watch._

  _Short explanation of MCTS and exploration of combining MCTS with other methods to create better agents._

- **What is MCTS by Swarthmore** — [Read](https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~mitchell/classes/cs63/f20/reading/mcts.html)  
  _Nice and concise article—easy to read, just a quick overview._

- **Monte Carlo Tree Search by Arushi Somani** — [Read](https://www.amks.me/notes/mcts/)  
  _Very nice read, good info on UCB, plus she has many other solid articles._
