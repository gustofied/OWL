### Research More Relevant for P2Engine

Oki, in nest/two here, while working I have found more relevant things for my work on P2Engine that I really. And I will note them
here and rotate over to P2Engine or some other place when I get time. So important to come back here when time comes. P2Engine is more looks like it, will be more a test arena of systems, and how to allign collective intelligence for a common goal between the local reasoners. (nice sentence:)

Most of the stuff here will be collective intelligence stuff, perhaps some observability stuff, systems, and maybe markets. multi agent systems in action, game theory etc..

1. https://www.softmax.com This seems cool, I like what they do, their writings, and the open contractor position seems highly matching. I think when P2Engine time comes again, come back to this, and use it as a good source when working on it.
