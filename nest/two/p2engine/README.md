### Research More Relevant for P2Engine

Oki, in nest/two here, while working I have found more relevant things for my work on P2Engine that I really. And I will note them
here and rotate over to P2Engine or some other place when I get time. So important to come back here when time comes. P2Engine is more looks like it, will be more a test arena of systems, and how to allign collective intelligence for a common goal between the local reasoners. (nice sentence:)

Most of the stuff here will be collective intelligence stuff, perhaps some observability stuff, systems, and maybe markets. multi agent systems in action, game theory etc..

1. https://www.softmax.com This seems cool, I like what they do, their writings, and the open contractor position seems highly matching. I think when P2Engine time comes again, come back to this, and use it as a good source when working on it.

2. I think the discussion and idea about depth vs fast is something to ponder on, when we build these systems what are optimizing for, get the answer as fast as possible, getting the answer the best as possible, how does the infra look for the both of them. Jo Bergum has some tweets on this.

3. I do find, the topic of formal verification interesting, and maybe not something that could be built with a P2Engine systems, it's relevant for the fact of creating systems that are verifable, which P2Engine wants to be some sources on this:
