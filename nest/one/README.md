#### OWL Diary

is owl just about the interaction space for now?

#### Observations

So observations is what the agents sees at one particular step, and is a subset of the total action space + metrics, moves etc?

Either way let's not drown ourselves in terms and concepts, just let's be clear that for a LLM agent
observatoins is the full systems + message prompt sent into the LLM model, and deciding observation space is
deciding what falls into here

This abouve one very interesting on how they translate into llm message?

Goes back into perhaps also in addition to building that observation space for the llm agent observation space could be increased by the agent itself looking into using a tool, where he could pick a number or sometthing from the stack in order to look back at history.. this is a bigger idea, the translation function it self in the lead above will be helpful

#### Drivers Runners

Agent runner?
