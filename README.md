<h1 align="center">OWL</h1>

<p align="center">

<b>OWL</b> wants to be a library, <b>OWL</b> is only a couple of weeks old, <b>OWL</b> wants to learn a lot, and maybe one day <b>OWL</b> can help others learn too.

Go to [owl/readme](./owl/README.md) and see what OWL currently is

<h4 align="left">What Am I Working On</h4>

Well when I started on OWL, I was thinking it would become a library OpenAI GYM esque but for LLM agents and with a lot of cool tooling, it might become that in the end, but right now it's more akin to a research project, where I build try to build 2D games (most basic, move arrow to goal point), have LLM Agents play them, and they learn to play them. So, we got some maths, we got games, we got some drivers, observation space building, and rewards. Exploring how to set it all up, and eventually OWL can be used to train agents using RL. I'm working on this in the month of September 2025, and in parallel with working/competing in [MindGames Competition](https://www.mindgamesarena.com) hope to inherit learnings from there into OWL. Also I started with a big scope of research, so research is large, I try to split what is focused for OWL and what is just my research (could be a part of OWL research), either way mostly RL stuff. So here is what I have done and will work on next for OWL. And the focus is to attack the textarena stuff, learnings from there apply here, and in general iterate on OWL game stuff.

TODO: fix this list

- [x] Env Bare Bones (game 1) — link?
- [x] Interaction LLM to ENV
- [x] Agent runner, engine driver simple
- [ ] Observability layer (W&B rerun)
- [ ] Trajectories

<h4 align="left">Research</h4>

<p align="left">
    OWL is a conintous research project. Owl maps out key practitioners and research labs, relevant papers, general knowledge, and tools/services of use. Opinions and discussions, articles and tweets. OWL is explorative, and loves to stay up-to-date, but also has a <b>taste</b>. It also knows he should focus, not have too broad of a scope, he knows he should only follow experts. Will OWL do what he is set out to do.

In [NEST/one](./nest/one) you will find learnings/research/diaries directly realted to OWL:

<ul align="left">
  <li><a href="./nest/one/origin_files/">Origin files</a> Files and code that guide the work</li>
  <li><a href="./nest/one/images">Images</a> Images for inspirations, code snippets, etc</li>
  <li><a href="./nest/one/docs">Docs</a> Learnings, diaries, tools, notes..++ </li>
</ul>

In [NEST/two](./nest/two) you will find interesting all research, AI, Agents, LLM, RL, and more:

<ul align="left">
  <li><a href="./nest/people">People</a> — profiles of researchers in the ML field</li>
  <li><a href="./nest/papers">Papers</a> — key publications and preprints</li>
  <li><a href="./nest/companies">Companies</a> — organisations working on cutting‑edge ML</li>
  <li><a href="./nest/labs">Labs</a> — academic and industry labs pushing the boundaries</li>
  <li><a href="./nest/two/mcts">/nest/two/MCTS</a> I started on a MCTS project, a game color, some large research here nice</li>
</ul>

<h4 align="left">Showcase</h4>

<p align="left">

Over time it would be nice to fill out a gallery with demo videos of OWL, different games, scenarios, runs here, a grid, a gallery, 2x2.
