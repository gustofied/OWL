<h1 align="center">OWL</h1>

<b>OWL</b> wants to be a library, <b>OWL</b> is only a couple of weeks old, <b>OWL</b> wants to learn a lot, and maybe one day <b>OWL</b> can help others learn too.

<h4 align="left">What Am I Working On</h4>

Well when I started on OWL, I was thinking it would become a libray OpenAI GYM esque but for LLM agents and with a lot of cool tooling, it might become that in the end, but right now it's more akin to a research project, where I build 2D games, have LLM Agents play them, and they learn to play them. So, we got some maths, we got games, we got some drivers, observation space building, and rewards. Exploring how to set it all up, and evntually OWL can be used to train agents using RL. Also I started with a big scope so research is large, I try to split what is focused for OWL and what is just my research (could be a part of OWL research), either way mostly RL stuff. So here is what I have done and will work on next for OWL

- [x] Env Bare Bones (game 1) — link?
- [x] Interaction LLM to ENV
- [x] Agent runner, engine driver simple
- [ ] Observability layer (W&B rerun)
- [ ] Trajectories

<h4 align="left">Research</h4>

OWL is concerned with reincfroncemt learning on agents,
MCTS, Gym ENVs, Agents internal, rl theory, envs, event loops. Comment [should also have a small toc? and exlpain things, we have splitt into mcts, rl, etc, you might find an exmaple project a game in mcts, while we alredy have envs, or rl in envc, they are general, but not al ecomposing] but as we state this autmn 2025 kinda all my work in this area is dumped into here as diary, as noting my resaecrh and things might be not directly impactful or related to OWL hence i split up nest into one and two, one ecompases directly resaerch impacted on owl,and two can also have impact but could be more too:)

<p align="left">
    OWL is a conintous research project. Owl maps out key practitioners and research labs, relevant papers, general knowledge, and tool of use. Opinions and discussions, articles and tweets. OWL is explorative, and loves to stay up-to-date, but also has a <b>taste</b>. It also knows he should focus, not have too broad of a scope, he knows he should only follow experts. Will OWL do what he is set out to do.

<p align="left">
  In NEST you will find interesting research:
</p>
<ul align="left">
  <li><a href="./nest/people">People</a> — profiles of researchers in the ML field</li>
  <li><a href="./nest/papers">Papers</a> — key publications and preprints</li>
  <li><a href="./nest/companies">Companies</a> — organisations working on cutting‑edge ML</li>
  <li><a href="./nest/labs">Labs</a> — academic and industry labs pushing the boundaries</li>
  <li><a href="./nest/tools">Tools</a> — libraries, frameworks, and utilities</li>
</ul>

</p>
<h5 align="left">Code</h5>
<p align="left">
    OWL includes not just what it deemed to be very good research he destill that infromation and builds his own proejcts, from x to y. From orchestration of groups collectives to x and y.
</p>

<h4 align="left">Framewrok</h4>

<p align="left">
    As we know OWL wants to be framework, and that is being built, it is right now very researchy here, but go into /owl and you will find something. A trainer, rl, env, gym, games, is it interesting? well yeh
</p>

<h4 align="left">Showcase</h4>

<p align="left">
    Here we can have link to specfic sub project or app or idea, and maybe a visual video gif or image, and people could click
    maybe to a gallery with imgaex and grid boxes
</p>

owl is currnlty also my main research, so anything close and related will be dumbed here see owl/nest/2
So kinda explain what owl is and what it currently does, then maybe say owl/nest/1 here we go in to diary theoru discusions , inspo and reorsrces, then nest /2 also relveant but also is my dump for current reserch in AI epsiacly towards RL, dump autumn 2025 many updates learnings and poejcts to come:)
