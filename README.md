<h1 align="center">OWL</h1>

<p align="center">

<b>OWL</b> wants to be a framework, <b>OWL</b> is only a couple of weeks old, <b>OWL</b> wants to learn a lot, and maybe one day <b>OWL</b> can help others learn too.

    OWL is a conintous research project. Owl maps out key practitioners and research labs, relevant papers, general knowledge, and tool of use. Opinions and discussions, articles and tweets. OWL is explorative, and loves to stay up-to-date, but also has a <b>taste</b>. It also knows he should focus, not have too broad of a scope, he knows he should only follow experts. Will OWL do what he is set out to do.

    As we know OWL wants to be framework, and that is being built, it is right now very researchy here, but go into /owl and you will find something. A trainer, rl, env, gym, games, is it interesting? well yeh
