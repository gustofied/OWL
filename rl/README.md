- [Training Agentic Reasoners — Will Brown, Prime Intellect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbHm2qKnu10)

Just a great overall video, first introducing the field, agents and rl on agents, many good analogies, and explanations. General overview not deeply technical. You get to touch a lot of the ideas/sayings and nuances of the field.

- [Will Brown: Abstractions for Agentic RL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aYJZysrQ9k)

Will Brown: Abstractions for Agentic RL. This one is a tad more technical would be nice to find slides too

- [[Full Workshop] Reinforcement Learning, Kernels, Reasoning, Quantization & Agents — Daniel Han The Workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkEGJ5G3foU&t)

Great 6 part video series here, A lot a lot but very good reinfromcent learning by the book mutual info, a bit heavy, a lot of notations etc

- [Reinforcement Learning, by the Book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFo9v_yKQXA&list=PLzvYlJMoZ02Dxtwe-MmH4nOB5jYlMGBjr)

Another series here.. by steve brunton, 8 part series, universy of washington

- [Reinforcement Learning: Machine Learning Meets Control Theory first video of the series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MNVhXEX9to&list=PLMrJAkhIeNNQe1JXNvaFvURxGY4gE9k74r)

- [Over a year ago (before joining OpenAI), I released LlamaGym: a tiny library to fine-tune LLM agents with online RL.] https://x.com/khoomeik/status/1919549712375677195
