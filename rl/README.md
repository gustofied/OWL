- [Training Agentic Reasoners — Will Brown, Prime Intellect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbHm2qKnu10)

Just a great overall video, first introducing the field, agents and rl on agents, many good analogies, and explanations. General overview not deeply technical. You get to touch a lot of the ideas/sayings and nuances of the field.

- [Will Brown: Abstractions for Agentic RL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aYJZysrQ9k)

Will Brown: Abstractions for Agentic RL. This one is a tad more technical would be nice to find slides too

- [[Full Workshop] Reinforcement Learning, Kernels, Reasoning, Quantization & Agents — Daniel Han The Workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkEGJ5G3foU&t)

A lot a lot but very good
