# Oki we are making a game that is connect four
# This implementation assumes the game state class includes:
# get_legal_actions(): returns valid actions.
# perform_action(action): returns a new state after applying an action.
# is_terminal(): checks if the state is terminal.
# get_result(): returns a result value (e.g., 1 for win, 0 for loss).
# last_action: stores the action that led to the current state.
# copy(): returns a deep copy of the state
# You can implement a simple demonstration for a Tic-Tac-Toe game for example.

# > Comment for myself: I'm interested in color theory see here, and wonder if I could turn this game in the future to be some pattern colour maker, and if the chaos
# of two players would indeed frutiled patterns that are pleasing, and thus this chaos, could show semlblnce of a bigger pattern towards intelgence, 
# as yes you could bulid a raw processor , but as we see they are not alligned and dont know what to do, but could this be som nice things, in andy fiedl medicine or somehting
