  Here are ideas I’m interested in exploring in this framework
</p>

<hr />

<h5 align="left">Dynamic Resource Allocation</h5>
<p align="left">
  One avenue worth investigating is how OWL’s orchestration capabilities can dynamically allocate computational resources when running multiple custom RL environments in parallel. By intelligently scaling up or down based on agent performance metrics, we can ensure faster convergence and more efficient training loops without overspending on infrastructure.
</p>

<h5 align="left">Active Learning Feedback Loops</h5>
<p align="left">
  Another concept to explore is integrating active learning feedback loops into LLM agent training. OWL could periodically query human or automated evaluators for the most informative samples, then retrain agents on those examples to boost their reasoning and decision‑making skills in challenging scenarios.
