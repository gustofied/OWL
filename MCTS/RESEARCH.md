### MCTS

**Fundamental resources for understanding the mechanics and motivations behind Monte Carlo Tree Search.**

- **Monte Carlo Tree Search Video by Michael Wollowski**  
  Overall great little video going into MCTS and some of its concepts.  
  [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99gPnlfr7Jo)

- **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) Tutorial Video by Fullstack Academy**  
  Dabbles into not just MCTS but more—gives a bigger grasp around MCTS, concise about MCTS, a bit unclear, but still a nice watch.
